# SparkReact

## Overview
SparkReact is a personal project created for my classmates to help them perform multiple lab calculations easily, along with additional math computations. Initially developed using PHP and HTML, the website was hosted on Infinity Free, where it gained popularity among students who provided positive feedback. Over time, the project was migrated to GitHub as a showcase of my work, and later, a React version was developed after learning the React framework.

## Features
- Perform multiple lab calculations efficiently.
- Includes a math calculation section for quick computations.
- A feedback page to gather user opinions and suggestions.
- Originally developed with PHP and HTML.
- React-based version created for improved user experience.
- API executes directly on the local machine for faster processing.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend:** PHP (Initial version)
- **Database:** MySQL (for storing feedback)
- **Hosting Platforms:** Infinity Free (initial), GitHub Pages (React version)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SparkReact.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd SparkReact
   ```
3. If running the PHP version, set up a local server using XAMPP or any other PHP environment.
4. For the React version:
   ```sh
   cd react-version
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- Open the website and choose the required lab calculation.
- Enter the necessary inputs and get instant results.
- Use the feedback page to share suggestions.
- If running the API, ensure it is executed on the local machine.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a backend API for the React version.
- Add more lab calculations and improve UI/UX.
- Deploy the React version on a hosting service.
